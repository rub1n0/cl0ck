- **Workout Mode** â€“ Alternates between work and rest intervals.
- **Timer Mode** â€“ Simple countdown timer with user-configurable durations.
- **Stopwatch Mode** â€“ Start/pause/reset functionality with high visibility.

The interface is clean, responsive, and styled using semantic Tailwind utility classes. The UI supports dark mode and is optimized for use in fullscreen kiosk-style displays or small browser windows.

## ðŸ”® Future: API Integration Plans

The next phase of development includes integrating APIs to enhance functionality:

- **Workout Sync API**: Allow users to import/export workout configurations from cloud storage or mobile apps.
- **Voice Control Integration**: Use Web Speech API to allow hands-free commands like "start timer", "switch to stopwatch".
- **Sensor Input**: Accept triggers from fitness hardware or Raspberry Pi GPIO to start/pause timers.
- **Session Analytics**: Push completed workout logs to a backend service for tracking and analysis.

API endpoints will be modular and designed for optional self-hosted backends or serverless deployment on platforms like Vercel or Cloudflare Workers.
